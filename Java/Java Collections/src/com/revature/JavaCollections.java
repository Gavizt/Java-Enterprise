		 * As a refresher, we use arrays in order to store multiple elements, using one reference
		 * to access all of these elements. That said, arrays are limiting depending on the task
		 * you're trying to complete. As such, we typically turn to our Collection implementations.
		 * 
		 * The Collection interface (the child of the Iterable interface) provides the core functionality
		 * for our Collection implementations (e.g. ArrayList, HashSet, PriorityBlockingQueue, etc.)
		 * 
		 * The Collection interface has several key subinterfaces: List, Set, and Queue. 
		 * 
		 * These interfaces have their own implementations. 
		 * 
		 * Reminder to talk about stack being bad practice to use. Use Deque instead.
